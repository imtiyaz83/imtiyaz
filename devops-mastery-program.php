					<p class="lead">The DevOps Mastery Program helps you become a complete developer. Do you know what it means to be a complete developer?</p>
					<p class="lead">If you are a frontend developer, you are not a complete developer. If you are a backend developer, you are not a complete developer. Even if you are a full-stack developer, you are still not a complete developer.</p>
					<p class="lead">Do you know why?</p>
					<p class="lead">Because in each situation, you are limited to some extent. If you are a frontend developer, you are not aware of what is happening on the backend. If you are a backend developer, you are not aware of what is happening on the frontend. Even if you are a full-stack developer, you may not be aware of what is happening on the server side.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">How do you deploy an application?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">What are different DevOps operations?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">How do you develop and deploy an application using Docker and Kubernetes with microservices?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">How do you prepare an infrastructure to deploy an application?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">How do you monitor an application?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">There could be various reasons to argue for limiting yourself by saying, "I am a frontend developer," "I am a backend developer," or "I am a full-stack developer. Why should I care about DevOps operations?" You might think there should be a separate team for that. Yes, you are right, my friend, there are separate teams for each area. So why should you care or think about all these things?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">This is the main reason many people do not grow enough in their careers. They limit themselves at each step.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Why? Why are you limiting yourself from learning new things?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Suppose an organization is looking for an ideal candidate to fulfill their requirements, and you are one of them. Who is the ideal candidate for that organization, and who will get selected for that position?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Obviously, if you have knowledge about all the technologies. It doesn't matter if the organization is looking for a backend engineer or a frontend engineer; if you have an extra layer of knowledge about server-side things like DevOps operations, you will be the first person to get selected from hundreds of other candidates.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">The DevOps Mastery Program enables you to become a DevOps engineer and will add an extra layer to your resume, showcasing your knowledge of DevOps operations. You will learn how to develop and deploy an application using Jenkins by creating a CI/CD pipeline, Docker as a containerization tool, and Kubernetes as an orchestration technology. You will also learn how to develop an application using microservices. If you are someone who is really keen to learn all these things, fill out the discovery form below without hesitation. I will see you soon.</p>
