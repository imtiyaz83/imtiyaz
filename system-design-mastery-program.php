					<p class="lead">Do you know what system design is?</p>
					<p class="lead">You can understand the concept of system design with a simple analogy. If I ask you to construct a building, what will you do? Will you start constructing your building right away, or will you first hire an architect to design an architecture for your building?</p>
					<p class="lead">The architect will design a building architecture for you to understand where your kitchen, balcony, drawing room, bedroom, servant room, or store will be. If you don't hire an architect, you can understand how poorly your building will be developed.</p>
					<p class="lead">I just want to help you understand with this simple example the importance of system design, whether in construction or software development. Similarly, you cannot develop a good software product if you don't know how to design a good system.</p>
					<p class="lead">Most people think that system design comes from experience. I agree with that, but I don't agree that it only comes from experience. No, that's not correct. Anyone can learn how to design a good system, and it's a good thing to know. If you want to learn the concepts of system design, you have to learn other tools and technologies as well. Without learning the necessary tools and technologies required to design and develop a good system, you can't understand the system design concepts.</p>
					<p class="lead">To become an expert in end-to-end system design concepts, you must learn and understand the following things:</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>1. Understand the Problem:</strong> First, you have to understand what problem you are going to solve and how. If you don't know what problem you are solving, you can't design and develop a good system.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>2. Feasibility and Tools:</strong> Once you understand the problem, you will be clear about various concepts like what technologies and tools will be feasible to develop that system. Where you need to use relational databases or NoSQL, whether to use open-source technologies, and whether to go with a monolithic approach or microservices-based architecture.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>3. Business Document:</strong> Prepare a business document detailing what you understand about the problem and the solution you are going to provide. This document will cover only business use cases, not technical things.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>4. High-Level Diagram:</strong> Design a rough high-level diagram on paper. When you start designing a high-level architecture diagram, it won't be complete in just one go but will take 3-5 iterations to satisfy your initial high-level architecture diagram.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>5. Convert Rough Diagrams:</strong> Convert all the rough diagrams you have drawn on paper using a tool like draw.io. When you convert your rough diagrams to actual diagrams, you will feel satisfied because now you will start seeing the actual image of the product you are going to develop. This is called a business flow system design document. It is still not technical.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>6. High-Level System Design (HLD):</strong> Convert this business system flow diagram into a high-level system design (HLD) document. An HLD document contains all technical flows of data, API calls, integration with other technologies or tools, and scalability.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>7. Low-Level Document (LLD):</strong> Prepare a low-level document based on your high-level document. An LLD document and diagram include all low-level details like the skeleton of the system, including design patterns, classes, models, views, and database structure.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>8. UI/UX Design:</strong> Based on the business document, a UI/UX is designed by a UI/UX team. Finalizing the UI/UX can take multiple iterations.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>9. Backend Development:</strong> Develop backend code or APIs to provide the required data to the frontend.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>10. Testing:</strong> Test the software product after integrating the APIs with the frontend.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>11. Infrastructure and Deployment:</strong> Prepare the infrastructure on the cloud and deploy the software product on the server based on the designed system architecture.</p>
					<p class="lead">System design is not only theoretical concepts; it includes various other technologies to design and develop a good system like Git, GitHub, Redis, ElasticSearch, MySQL, NoSQL, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, Kubernetes, Grafana, Kibana, etc. System design is not just about drawing HLD or LLD diagrams. It includes all the tools and technologies required to design and develop a scalable system.</p>
					<p class="lead">Learning system design is not an easy task. Even after 15-16 years of experience, people may not be able to design a good system, so itâ€™s a false statement that system design comes only from experience. I say anyone can learn system design, whether you are a fresher or experienced. If you are a fresher, you may take more time compared to an experienced person. If you have more than three years of experience, you must start learning system design concepts. This can help you grow faster in your career compared to someone who is just stuck in writing code.</p>
					<p class="lead">If you are someone who wants to learn about the concepts of system design, don't worry. Along with your job, I can help you. You just need to fill out the discovery form. I will connect with you soon.</p>
					<p class="lead">Good luck!</p>
