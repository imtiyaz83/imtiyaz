					<p class="lead">If I ask you to go to the roof of a building, how will you go? Will you use the staircases or go directly without them? This is just an example to help you understand how essential understanding the concepts of web development or software product development is.</p>
					<p class="lead">You want to build your career in AI, Machine Learning, IoT, Cyber Security, Robotics, Cloud Computing, or Data Analytics. Thatâ€™s great, my friend. No one is stopping you, but for that, you must understand the concepts of software product development.</p>
					<p class="lead">To build a robot, first you have to understand and learn the concepts and steps needed to build a robot. Only then will you be able to build a robot, right?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Having knowledge is not a bad thing, no matter what the area is. If the area is related, then I would say you must understand or learn all the related things. Suppose you want to become an AI Engineer, a Cloud Engineer, or a Cyber Security Engineer. If you donâ€™t know how a software application is developed and works, then how will you apply your knowledge in Cyber Security, AI, or Cloud Computing?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">All modern technologies work based on software development. There is no existence of these technologies without software development. Software development is the foundation for all these technologies. Before entering into other technologies, you must understand the end-to-end software development concepts.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">To learn end-to-end software development, you must understand and learn the following things:
					</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ What is software development?</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ Career scope in software development</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ How to think about a problem and how to execute a plan to solve a problem</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and how to develop an MVP?</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ What are frontend technologies and backend technologies?</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ What are the different types of databases?</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ What are APIs and how to write backend code or APIs?</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ How to integrate the front-end with the backend</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ How to test a software product</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ How to book a domain and deploy a software product on a server</p>
					<p class="lead">ðŸ‘‰ How to prioritize and develop the complete software product in different cycles</p>
</p>
