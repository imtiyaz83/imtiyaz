					<p class="lead">What really matters for a startup's success?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Building a world-class product or service?</p> <p class="lead">Hiring a world-class team of people?
</p><p class="lead">Using world-class tools or technologies? </p>OR <p class="lead"> Huge funding?</p><p class="lead">What do you think?</p><p class="lead">None of these alone.</p>

					</p>
					<p class="lead">For a startup's success, none of these are solely required. You might be surprised and curious about then what is really required for a startup's success.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">To run a startup, the foremost requirement is an unstoppable mindset and an unbreakable personality. A mindset that can't be stopped and a personality that can't be broken. For a successful startup, a positive mindset, a lot of courage, confidence, and risk-taking capability are essential. Products or services, teams, tools, or technologies come later.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">If you don't have an unstoppable mindset or an unbreakable personality, no matter how world-class your product or service is, no matter how world-class your team is, and no matter how much funding you have, you can't run a successful startup, my friend.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Running a successful startup is not a joke. That's the reason most startups fail—they don't have an unstoppable mindset and an unbreakable personality. If you are running a startup, you must be ready to face a lot of ups, downs, challenges, and struggles. Otherwise, you will behave like an immature person. If your product or service is not working as expected, you will start crying. If something is not working as per your plan, you will start complaining. If there is a funding problem, you may lose your temper and start blaming your employees. With all these symptoms, you can't run a startup. There will be a lot of uncertainties. You need to do a lot of hits and trials. So, first and foremost, you have to be prepared to become an unstoppable entrepreneur, no matter what.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Once you develop an unstoppable mindset and an unbreakable personality, the second step is to think about the problem. What problem are you going to solve for society? Obviously, you want to earn money, but your intention should be clear that your solution will impact or contribute to a specific group of people in society. You must have a clear target audience whom you are going to help. It doesn't matter whom you are going to help—you don't need to serve the whole world. You can solve a problem for your ward, your town, city, state, or country rather than the whole world. Accordingly, you have to plan your product, services, marketing, or selling strategies.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Before developing an actual product or service, first, you have to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) rather than investing your time and effort in developing a world-class product or service. Quickly build an MVP, launch it, and start getting feedback from your target audience. You can refine, develop, and launch a complete product or service after getting inputs and feedback from your real users.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">I worked for 11 years with two startups and wrote a book, "Startup Journey: How to Build, Grow, and Scale a Product?" I am closely working with startups, not only building and scaling products or services but also fostering an unstoppable mindset and unbreakable personality, setting up new strategies, building teams, and creating new processes. I can closely work with you as well to make your startup successful. I work as part of your team and collaborate with different teams to execute strategies and plans.
