					<p class="lead">The college-to-corporate (C@C) program is designed to keep in mind tier 3 or tier 4 colleges and universities.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Why am I considering only tier 3 or tier 4 colleges?
						</p>
					<p class="lead">Because I, myself, come from a tier 4 college and faced many challenges and struggles to get a job in the corporate world. Throughout my career, I kept thinking that one day I would do something to uplift tier 3 or tier 4 colleges and their students, helping them secure jobs as easily and quickly as those from tier 1 or tier 2 colleges.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Tier 1 and tier 2 colleges have already become brands, and companies do not hesitate to select their students.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Do you know why?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Because they have their brand value.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">But have you thought about what efforts they put in to become a brand?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">They focus more on meeting corporate demands rather than just completing the syllabus or provide degrees to the students. They provide various corporate programs on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis and pay for different corporate trainers. They even have permanent positions for corporate training programs to fill the gap between college and corporate journeys. That’s why their students get good placements.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Do you know why tier 3 or tier 4 colleges and their students struggle to get placements?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">The reason is simple and straightforward: they don’t want to invest in themselves to become a brand. Becoming a brand takes time and effort, and you have to spend money as well. Rather than relying on the students, colleges should take the initiative to partner with different corporate trainers to provide regular training, not just at the last moment but from the first year to the final year. Alongside the students' syllabus, you must work on what the corporate world actually demands.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">What do companies want?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Rather than just focusing on the theoretical part, you need to focus more on the practical part from the starting. This is the only way to improve your placement ratio and brand value.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">But there is good news for all tier 3 or tier 4 colleges. I have designed a program specifically for tier 3 or tier 4 colleges. The college-to-corporate program (C@C) helps colleges improve their brand value and placement ratio and assists students in securing jobs. This program offers 3-day workshops on a quarterly basis, covering the entire college-to-corporate journey.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">The C@C program focuses not only on technical skills but also on non-technical skills such as communication skills, developing an unstoppable mindset, building an unbreakable personality, preparing for a job, creating a first resume, and cracking an interview. If a candidate is confident and has the required technical skills, don’t you think he/she will get selected easily in the first round of interviews?
					</p>
					<p class="lead">Sounds good.
